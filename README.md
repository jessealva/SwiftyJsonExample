# SwiftyJsonExample
Simple Example for using SwiftyJson


This sample currently is used to show the IBM Swift Sandbox and IBM Swift Package Catalog (SPC) integration.

As the code is intended to run in Linux, the version of SwiftyJson used is v3. As of right now this code only works if you run with a Swift 3.0 development build older than March 1, 2016. There were other issues with the later builds and SwiftyJson/Swift in general that are preventing it from being used with the latest version of SwiftyJson and Swift development build.
